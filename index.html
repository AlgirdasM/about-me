                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey with computers began in the summer of 1992. At the time, dad bought me my first laptop with a
                    black and white screen; a 386 Intel processor; an 80 megabyte hard drive, and 4 megabytes of RAM. This
                    computer, which was equated to a technical miracle, had an MS DOS operating system and a Windows 3.1
                    program (at that time it was still just a program, not an operating system). My father’s friend Sigitas
                    helped me buy a computer and because of that he became my first teacher.
                </p>
                <h3>To try everything that is interesting</h3>
                <p>
                    Sigitas very quickly taught me to understand computer systems using comparisons and real-life examples.
                    I learned one important rule from him: “If you find something interesting on your computer, try it, and
                    if something breaks up, don’t be afraid, you can always fix it.” Of course, I also learned to read the
                    documentation, but it wasn’t complete on all systems, there were a lot of undescribed features.
                </p>
                <h3>Inspired by “Terminator”</h3>
                <p>
                    I didn’t have Internet access at the time, but I wanted to access as many programs as possible, so I had
                    to learn programming. The first languages I started learning were Basic and Turbo Pascal. It helped me
                    develop logical thinking and apply the knowledge I gained in real life. Although the programs were
                    simple, I still remember one of them. In the movie, called Terminator 2, John Connor breaks into an ATM
                    using a computer and steals all the money. No, I didn’t rob the ATM, but I knew how to use the same
                    program, which I proudly showed to my friends. After that, their jaws dropped, and to me it was like
                    another puzzle put together.
                </p>
                <h3>Windows 95, the one that changed the world</h3>
                <p>
                    Around 1995, I got a second computer with Windows 95 operating system and another innovation - a 9.6
                    kbps speed router. It shook my world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Altavista searches, IRC channels, forums... I spent almost all of
                    my free time on-line looking for new tools and programs. I also started to learn another programming
                    language, called Delphi. It was a familiar, but at the same time completely new experience. Although the
                    logic itself did not differ from other languages, new graphical elements emerged that were better
                    adapted to ordinary users.
                </p>
                <h3>Linux tryouts</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1999, I first tested the Linux-Slackware distribution. Although I was used to the command line, the
                    world of Linux turned out to be different. Because I did not know how to connect to the Internet and
                    launch a browser, I had to restart my computer, turn on Windows, and search for information many times.
                    However, over the time, it became increasingly clear how to use this innovation. And to make the job
                    easier for me, I learned how to write bash characters.
                </p>
                <h3>Two computers can do more than one</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, I didn’t notice how I started working with two computers at the same time: I used one for work
                    and turned the other into a home server. Its purpose was to share Internet access and run an IRC bot. I
                    started to like the services more and more, so I learned to compile and run virtual servers: Apache,
                    PHP, MySQL. At the same time, I was very interested in creating websites using PHP, Javascript, and
                    Flash technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remembering the quote `&quot;if you find something interesting on your computer, try it&quot; since
                    childhood, I became interested not only in Linux systems such as OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris,
                    OpenVMS, but even Plan9. Many of the tests were proceeded using polarhome.com. By the way, this service
                    still works!
                </p>
                <h3>Higher education steps</h3>
                <p>
                    After graduating from school, I felt a little confused; although I had accumulated a lot of knowledge,
                    but because I did not have enough good grades, I could not enter where I wanted to. This is where I
                    remembered my second hobby, the audiovisual arts. So, after a short search of myself, I applied to
                    Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) and got accepted. School grades allowed me to choose only the
                    status of a free listener, but I decided to study under such conditions as well (free listeners do not
                    receive a diploma and has to pay the full tuition fee). My chosen university is mainly for exact
                    sciences, so IT knowledge and logical thinking paid off quickly; I was added to the student lists after
                    the first semester and became a full-fledged student. Half a year later, I got into a state-funded
                    place. I am glad that in addition to the subject I was studying, I was always able to choose programming
                    lectures. During my studies, I further deepened this knowledge, got acquainted with C#, MS SQL
                    databases.
                </p>
                <h3>The bread of a graphic designer and photographer</h3>
                <p>
                    While still studying at university, I started working as a graphic designer, but at the same time I was
                    able to help the company manage its IT issues. The computer was always at hand, and in my free time from
                    lectures and work, I enjoyed programming and building new systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I was very successful in photography, so a few years after graduating from university, I
                    started working as a freelance photographer. One by one, new interesting projects emerged, which brought
                    me into this world. However, as soon as the design works occurred, I returned to them.
                </p>
                <h3>The programmer, who found his way</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2015, I founded my own advertising and programming services company. At that time, I became really
                    interested in e-commerce. I chose the PrestaShop system and using the knowledge that I had I created the
                    first e-shop. The success of this project allowed us to offer our clients more programming services and
                    at the same time reduce advertising costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a very exciting period of my life. I developed a POS system for e-commerce using React and REST
                    API platforms, a loyalty program customer database with Laravel and Vue.js, a rental time calculation
                    tool with Arduino and RFID cards, Python, MariaBD and similar systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But over the time, I got tired of being a one-man team. I didn’t want to play the roles of both director
                    and sales manager because I was most interested in programming. I decided to focus on it, so I joined
                    the company. When being a part of it, I can learn from colleagues, share my knowledge with them and
                    create complex solutions together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the moment, I’m glad I’m a programmer who has discovered the perfect path and loves his job
                    endlessly!
